# Day 4 â€“ Python Functions & Student Grade Report

On Day 4, I practiced how to define and use functions to make my code more reusable, modular, and readable. I applied these concepts in both small utility functions and a complete student grading system.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- `def` keyword for defining functions
- Function parameters and return values
- Difference between `return` vs `print`
- Calling functions with user input
- Using functions to calculate:
  - Sum of numbers
  - Even/odd checker
  - Grade letter from score
- Nested dictionaries for structured data
- Sorting dictionary output
- Aggregating data (average, top score)

## ðŸ“‹ What This Script Does

### 1. `greet(name)`

- Prints a personalized greeting message.

### 2. `add_numbers(a, b)`

- Adds two user-input numbers and returns the result.

### 3. `is_even(number)`

- Checks if a number is even or odd.

### 4. Student Grade Report System

- Asks how many students are in the class.
- For each student:
  - Takes name and score (0â€“100)
  - Uses `get_letter_grade(score)` to return a grade from A to F
- Stores all student data in a dictionary.
- Prints a full report:
  - Each student's name, score, and grade (sorted alphabetically)
