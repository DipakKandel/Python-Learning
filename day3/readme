# Day 3 – Loops, Lists, and Repetition

Today I practiced how to work with loops, lists, and user input in Python. These are essential building blocks for automating tasks, collecting data, and creating flexible programs.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- `for` and `while` loops
- List creation and manipulation
- The `enumerate()` function for indexed loops
- Using `reversed()` for clean backward iteration
- Built-in functions like `sum()`, `max()`, and `min()`
- Basic data analysis with user inputs

## 🔁 What This Script Does

### 1. To-Do List with `append()` and `enumerate()`

- Creates a basic to-do list with a single item
- Uses `enumerate()` to print list items with their index

### 2. Loop Through a String

- Demonstrates how `for` can iterate through each letter of a word

### 3. Favorite Fruits Collector

- Asks the user to enter their favorite fruits (until they type `done`)
- Stores all fruits in a list
- Prints the fruits in reverse order
- Also prints the fruits with index using `enumerate()`

### 4. Number Analyzer

- Asks the user to enter 5 numbers one at a time
- Stores the numbers in a list
- Prints:
  - Each number entered
  - The average of the numbers
  - The highest number
  - The lowest number

## 🔍 Why This Matters

These skills are foundational for real-world apps like:

- Shopping carts
- Data input forms
- Report generators
- Chatbots and AI prompt loops

I now have more confidence in writing loops efficiently, choosing the right loop type, and using list-based logic in actual applications.
