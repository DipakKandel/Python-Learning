# ðŸ•’ Day 7 â€“ Working with Date & Time in Python

This day focused on understanding how Python handles dates, times, and durations. These concepts are essential for real-world applications like activity tracking, log timestamps, and scheduling systems.

## âœ… What I Practiced

### 1. Capturing the Current Time

- Retrieved the current system time using Pythonâ€™s datetime module.
- Displayed login time in a clean, readable format.

### 2. Formatting Time Strings

- Used strftime to extract parts of the datetime (like year, hour, minute).
- Converted date and time into human-friendly phrases.

### 3. Pausing Execution

- Introduced short delays using time.sleep to simulate real-time behavior.

### 4. Countdown to New Year

- Calculated how many days are left until the next January 1st.
- Learned how to perform arithmetic between date objects.

### 5. Age Calculator

- Asked the user for their birthdate and calculated their current age.
- Practiced converting string input into datetime objects.

### 6. Date Difference Tool

- Took two dates and calculated how many days apart they are.
- Checked whether a given date is in the past or the future.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- `datetime.now()` for current timestamp
- `strftime()` for formatting
- `strptime()` for parsing user-input dates
- Date subtraction for timedelta
- `.days` to extract total days difference
- `sleep()` for simulating delay

## ðŸ’¼ Real-World Applications

- Activity logs with timestamps
- Daily reminders or countdown systems
- Form validation (birthdate, deadlines)
- Timestamping journal entries
- Time-based automation or analytics
