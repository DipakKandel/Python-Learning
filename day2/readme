# Day 2 â€“ Conditional Logic (if/else, comparison operators)

Today I practiced how to use conditional statements in Python to make decisions based on user input.

## âœ… Concepts Covered:

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Chained comparisons: `13 <= age < 18`
- Clean handling of user input using `.lower()`

## ðŸ’» Mini Project: Movie Ticket Recommender

The program:

- Asks the user for their age
- Recommends types of movies based on age group:
  - Under 13 â†’ "You can watch cartoon movies"
  - 13â€“17 â†’ "You can watch anime and drama"
  - 18+ â†’ "You can watch any movie"
- Asks if the user is a student
- If yes, shows: "You get a student discount!"
